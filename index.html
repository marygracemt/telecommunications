			It is a way of communicating or exchanging information over distances that can take various forms. 
			This plays a crucial role in everyone's lives, allowing them to interact despite being miles away. 
			This can be transferred through different mediums like electromagnetic fields, light, cable, fiber, 
			and many more.</p>
			<br>
			<p class = "text1cont"> Its medium before was voice, but as time evolved, video, data, and text could also be 
			sent back and forth. This can be offered by various corporations that provide services that 
			allow individuals and businesses to do their tasks using it. This can also be done with a 
			wide range of technologies. And this is still evolving for further improvements. </p>
